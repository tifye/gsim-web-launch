A tool I began on in my free time for my work at Huqvarna Robotics R&D to simplify our simulator workflow. Work on this idea was moved to [tools-cli](https://github.com/tifye/tools-cli).

From the internal web portal the user can simply click a button and all the necessary files and programs will be downloaded and ran. Prevously the user would have to do everything manually for the specific setup they wanted to run.
